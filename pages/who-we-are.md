### Who We Are

Started in June 2019, the **Singapore Together** movement is about the government and Singaporeans working in partnership to address complex challenges and build our future Singapore.

Our robust SG United response to the current COVID-19 situation epitomises what Singapore Together is about. We will only be able to overcome this threat if all of us – the government, Singaporeans, businesses, community groups – work together.

The Government will open up more partnership opportunities for Singaporeans to participate. The Government also hopes to support more citizen-led efforts. Whatever our background or interests, we can each step forward to contribute in areas that we care about. By working together, we can turn diversity into strength and transform challenges into opportunities, to build a Singapore that present and future generations of Singaporeans will be proud of.
